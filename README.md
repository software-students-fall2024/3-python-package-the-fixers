# Python Package Exercise

An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

The purpose of our functions is to promote regular wellness breaks that help reduce physical and mental strain. Each function offers tailored suggestions for brief activities—such as stretching, eye exercises, movement, and mental exercises—that encourage a balanced, healthy routine throughout the day, especially for individuals with sedentary or screen-heavy tasks.
